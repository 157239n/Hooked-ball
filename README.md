# Hooked ball

This is just a ball with an inner diameter of 14cm. It is splitted into 2 hemispheres, one hemisphere has a hoop attached to it so that it can be connected to a tether. The upper and lower halves will be connected by 2 bolts or 2 piece of strings.

This is first intended to be filled with dirt or wet sand in order to give it some mass to perform the pendulum experiment. The experiment involves a person holding up the ball right in front of them and release it, then waits for it to come back to just touch his/her face.

These are the results in which I have printed:
